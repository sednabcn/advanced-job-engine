## Core Concepts

### 1. Match Score (0-100%)

Your **compatibility** with a job based on:
- **Required skills** (35% weight) - Must-have technical skills
- **Experience** (20% weight) - Years of relevant experience
- **Keywords** (15% weight) - Important terms in job description
- **Preferred skills** (15% weight) - Nice-to-have skills
- **Education** (10% weight) - Degree requirements
- **Certifications** (5% weight) - Professional credentials

**Example:**
```
Match Score: 72%

Breakdown:
  Required Skills:   60%  (6/10 skills matched)
  Experience:        80%  (4 years, need 5)
  Keywords:          75%  (strong keyword alignment)
  Preferred Skills:  50%  (2/4 nice-to-haves)
  Education:        100%  (Bachelor's matches)
  Certifications:     0%  (none of 2 required)
```

### 2. Gap Analysis

**What you're missing** to be competitive:

```

## Your First Analysis

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

#### Your CV

```bash
# Copy your CV to the data directory
cp /path/to/your/cv.pdf data/my_cv.pdf
```

**Tips for best results:**
- Include clear "Skills" section
- List specific technologies (not "various frameworks")
- Mention years of experience explicitly
- Use standard section headers

**Example CV structure:**
```
SKILLS
‚Ä¢ Programming: Python, JavaScript, Java
‚Ä¢ Frameworks: React, Django, Flask
‚Ä¢ Tools: Docker, Git, PostgreSQL
‚Ä¢ Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)

EXPERIENCE
Senior Developer | Company | 2020-Present (4 years)
- Led development of microservices using Docker and Kubernetes
- Improved system performance by 40%
```

#### Job Description

```bash
# Copy job description
cp /path/to/job.pdf data/target_job.pdf

# Or create from text
nano data/target_job.txt
# Paste job description, save and exit
```

### Step 2: Run Your First Analysis

#### Interactive Mode (Beginner-Friendly)

```bash
python src/python_advanced_job_engine.py
```

Follow the prompts:
1. Choose option `2` (Analyze from files)
2. Enter: `data/my_cv.pdf`
3. Enter: `data/target_job.pdf`
4. Enter job title (optional): `Senior ML Engineer`
5. Enter company (optional): `TechCorp`

#### Script Mode (Quick)

```python
from src.python_advanced_job_engine import AdvancedJobEngine

# Initialize
engine = AdvancedJobEngine()

# Run analysis
analysis = engine.analyze_from_files(
    cv_file="data/my_cv.pdf",
    job_file="data/target_job.pdf",
    job_title="Senior ML Engineer",
    company="TechCorp Inc."
)

# Print results
print(f"Match Score: {analysis['score']['total_score']}%")
```

### Step 3: Review Your Results

The analysis returns:

1. **Match Score** - Your overall compatibility (0-100%)
2. **Score Breakdown** - Each component's contribution
3. **Gap Analysis** - What you're missing
4. **Extracted Data** - What was found in your CV
5. **Job Requirements** - What the job needs

## Understanding Results

### Match Score Interpretation

| Score | Status | Meaning | Action |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| **90-100%** | üü¢ Excellent | You're highly qualified | Apply now! |
| **75-89%** | üü° Strong | Minor gaps, very competitive | Quick polish, then apply |
| **60-74%** | üü† Good | Solid foundation, work needed | 4-12 weeks learning |
| **45-59%** | üî¥ Fair | Significant gaps | 12-20 weeks learning |
| **<45%** | ‚ö´ Poor | Major mismatch | Consider different role or 20+ weeks prep |

### Reading the Breakdown

```python
{
  'total_score': 68,
  'breakdown': {
    'required_skills': 55,      # 35% weight ‚Üí 19.25 points
    'preferred_skills': 60,     # 15% weight ‚Üí 9.0 points
    'experience': 80,           # 20% weight ‚Üí 16.0 points
    'education': 100,           # 10% weight ‚Üí 10.0 points
    'certifications': 0,        # 5% weight ‚Üí 0 points
    'keywords': 75              # 15% weight ‚Üí 11.25 points
  }
}

Total: 19.25 + 9.0 + 16.0 + 10.0 + 0 + 11.25 = 65.5 ‚âà 68%
```

**Priority for improvement:**
1. Fix required skills (highest weight: 35%)
2. Address experience gap (20% weight)
3. Add relevant keywords (15% weight)
4. Learn preferred skills (15% weight)
5. Get certifications if needed (5% weight)

### Understanding Gaps

```python
{
  'missing_required_skills': [
    'Docker',      # Priority 1
    'Kubernetes',  # Priority 1
    'AWS',         # Priority 1
    'CI/CD'        # Priority 1
  ],
  'missing_preferred_skills': [
    'Redis',       # Priority 2
    'GraphQL'      # Priority 2
  ],
  'experience_gap': 1,  # 1 year short
  'education_gap': None  # Meets requirement
}
```

**Action plan:**
1. Learn the 4 missing required skills (top priority)
2. Build projects using these skills
3. Consider preferred skills (bonus points)
4. Highlight experience creatively (can't change years, but can emphasize depth)

## Common First-Time Questions

### Q: My score seems low. Is the tool accurate?

**A:** Scores are algorithmic estimates (85-90% reliable for tech roles). If your score seems off:

1. Check what was extracted:
```python
cv_data = engine.parse_cv(cv_text)
print("Skills found:", cv_data['skills'])
```

2. Improve CV formatting:
   - Add explicit "Skills" section
   - Use bullet points
   - List technologies specifically

3. Re-run analysis

### Q: Should I apply if my score is 65%?

**A:** It depends:
- **Need job urgently?** ‚Üí Apply now, but expect competition
- **Can wait 1-2 months?** ‚Üí Build skills to 75%+ first (better odds)
- **Career transition?** ‚Üí Aim for 80%+ (stand out)

### Q: Can I improve my score without learning new skills?

**A:** Yes! Often 5-10% improvement possible by:
- Better CV formatting
- Adding relevant keywords
- Emphasizing matching experience
- Quantifying achievements

### Q: How long until I'm ready to apply?

**A:** Depends on starting score:
- **75%+**: Apply now
- **60-74%**: 4-12 weeks
- **45-59%**: 12-20 weeks
- **<45%**: 20+ weeks or consider different role
