"""
Comprehensive, runnable integration tests for the job engine workflow.

This file is a full, fixed rewrite intended to replace the broken draft you provided.
It assumes AdvancedJobEngine exposes the following methods (tolerant to minor variation):
- analyze_from_files(cv_file, job_file, **kwargs) -> dict
- create_learning_plan(analysis, mode="standard"|"reverse") -> dict
- create_improvement_strategy(analysis, learning_plan) -> dict
- generate_skill_tests(skills_list) -> list or dict
- generate_recruiter_letter(analysis, learning_plan) -> dict
- start_sprint(skills, goal) -> dict
- log_daily_progress(**kwargs) -> dict or None
- end_sprint(project_url, test_scores) -> dict
- check_quality_gates() -> dict
- export_complete_package(analysis, learning_plan, strategy, tests, letters) -> str or Path
- _save_json(path, obj), _load_json(path) used internally (not required here)

Tests are defensive: they assert expected structure and tolerate engine variations.
