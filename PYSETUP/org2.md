pytest-cov>=4.0.0GitHub Actions Workflow with CoverageCode¬†name: Test Suite

on:
  push:

  pull_request:

    steps:
    -Perfect! I've created three helpful artifacts for you:
1. GitHub Actions Workflow
A complete CI/CD workflow that:

Runs tests with coverage on push/PR
Tests against multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
Uploads coverage to Codecov
Caches dependencies for faster runs
Archives coverage reports as artifacts

2. pytest.ini Configuration
A pytest configuration file that:

Sets up test discovery patterns
Configures coverage thresholds (80% minimum)
Excludes common patterns from coverage
Adds useful default options
Shows missing lines in coverage report

3. Makefile with Test Commands
Convenient make commands for local development:
bash# Basic testing
make test              # Run tests with coverage
make test-unit         # Run unit tests only (fast)
make test-fast         # No coverage (fastest)

# Coverage reports
make test-cov          # Coverage with missing lines
make test-cov-html     # HTML report (opens in browser)

# Debugging
make test-failed       # Re-run only failed tests
make test-match        # Run tests matching a pattern

# Cleanup
make clean             # Remove test artifacts
Quick Setup:

Install coverage tool:

bash   pip install pytest-cov

Run tests with coverage:

bash   pytest tests/unit/ -vv --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term

Or use the Makefile:

bash   make test
The coverage report will show you:

Which lines of code are tested
Which lines are missing tests
Overall coverage percentage
Coverage by file

This setup matches what you'd use in CI/CD while also being convenient for local development! üéØRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.PWhat does the coverage?Great question! Let me explain what code coverage is and what it measures:
What is Code Coverage?
Code coverage is a metric that measures how much of your source code is executed when your tests run. It tells you which lines, branches, and functions in your code are actually being tested.
What the Coverage Reports Show:
When you run:
bashpytest tests/unit/ -vv --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term
```

You'll see something like this in your terminal:
```
---------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.11.0 -----------

Column Meanings:
ColumnMeaningStmtsTotal number of executable statements in the fileMissNumber of statements NOT executed during testsCoverPercentage of code covered (Stmts - Miss) / Stmts √ó 100%MissingSpecific line numbers that weren't executed
What Does It Cover?
1. Line Coverage (Most Common)
pythondef calculate_score(cv_skills, job_skills):
    if not cv_skills:           # ‚úÖ Line executed
        return 0                # ‚ùå Line NOT executed (no test for empty cv_skills)
    
    matches = set(cv_skills) & set(job_skills)  # ‚úÖ Line executed
    return len(matches)         # ‚úÖ Line executed
If your test only calls calculate_score(['Python'], ['Python', 'Java']), the return 0 line is not covered.
2. Branch Coverage
pythondef process_cv(cv_text):
    if cv_text:                 # Both True and False paths should be tested
        return parse(cv_text)   # ‚úÖ Covered
    else:
        return {}               # ‚ùå Not covered (need test with empty string)
3. Function Coverage
pythondef extract_skills(text):       # ‚úÖ Function is called in tests
    # ...

def extract_certifications(text):  # ‚ùå Function never called in tests
    # ...
Example with Your Code:
Looking at your CV parser test failure, the actual parser returns:
python{
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'email': 'john.doe@email.com',
    'phone': '+1-234-567-8900',
    'skills': ['Python', 'Django', ...],
    'experience': [...],
    'education': [],  # ‚ùå Empty - extraction code might not be covered
    'certifications': ['AWS Certified Solutions Architect']
}
```

If `education` is always empty, it means:
- ‚úÖ The code to initialize `education: []` is covered
- ‚ùå The code to actually extract education data is NOT covered (never executed)

## **Why Coverage Matters:**

### **Good Coverage (75%+):**
```
‚úÖ Most code paths are tested
‚úÖ Edge cases are handled
‚úÖ More confidence in refactoring
‚úÖ Catches obvious bugs
```

### **Poor Coverage (<50%):**
```
‚ùå Large parts of code untested
‚ùå Bugs can hide in untested code
‚ùå Refactoring is risky
‚ùå Edge cases might fail in production
What Coverage Reports Help You Find:

Untested Functions:

python   def _calculate_years_experience(self, experience):  # 0% coverage
       # This function exists but no test calls it

Missing Edge Cases:

python   if skills:
       return process(skills)  # ‚úÖ Tested
   else:
       return []               # ‚ùå Not tested (need empty skills test)

Dead Code:

python   def old_parser(text):  # 0% coverage - maybe can be deleted?
       # Nobody uses this anymore

Exception Handling:

python   try:
       result = parse_date(date_str)  # ‚úÖ Tested
   except ValueError:
       return None                     # ‚ùå Not tested (need invalid date test)
How to Read Your Coverage Report:
After running with coverage, you can open the HTML report:
bashpytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # Opens in browser
You'll see:

üü¢ Green lines = executed during tests
üî¥ Red lines = NOT executed during tests
üü° Yellow lines = partially executed (some branches not taken)

Coverage Goals:
Coverage %StatusMeaning90-100%ExcellentVery thorough testing75-90%GoodMost code paths tested50-75%FairBasic testing, gaps exist<50%PoorLarge portions untested
Important Note:
High coverage ‚â† Good tests! You can have 100% coverage with bad tests:
pythondef divide(a, b):
    return a / b  # ‚úÖ 100% coverage, but...

# Bad test (doesn't catch division by zero):
def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5  # Passes, but misses edge case!
Coverage tells you what code ran, not if it was tested well! üéØRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.P-cov=src looking in this directory?Yes, exactly! --cov=src tells pytest-cov to measure coverage for all Python code in the src directory.
What --cov=src Does:

How It Works:
When you run:
bashpytest tests/unit/ -vv --cov=src --cov-report=term
pytest-cov:

‚úÖ Runs all tests in tests/unit/
‚úÖ Monitors which lines in src/ are executed
‚úÖ Generates a report showing coverage for src/ only
‚ùå Ignores coverage of test files themselves

Other Coverage Options:
Measure specific module:
bashpytest tests/unit/ --cov=src.analyzers
Only measures src/analyzers/ directory
Measure multiple directories:
bashpytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov=lib
Measures both src/ and lib/ directories
Measure specific file:
bashpytest tests/unit/ --cov=src.analyzers.cv_parser
Only measures src/analyzers/cv_parser.py
Measure everything (current directory):
bashpytest tests/unit/ --cov=.
```
Measures ALL Python files (including tests - usually not what you want)

## **Example Output:**

With `--cov=src`, you'll see:
```
---------- coverage: platform linux, python 3.11.0 -----------
Name                                    Stmts   Miss  Cover

-----------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                     322     80    75%
Notice it ONLY shows files in src/, not tests/.
Why Not Measure Tests?
You typically don't want coverage of your test files because:

Tests are supposed to run (so they'd always be 100% covered)
You care about testing your production code, not test code
It would inflate your coverage numbers

Configuration in pytest.ini:
You can also configure this in pytest.ini:
ini[coverage:run]
source = src              # Same as --cov=src
omit =
    */tests/*            # Explicitly exclude tests
    */test_*.py          # Exclude test files
    */__pycache__/*      # Exclude cache
Then you can just run:
bashpytest tests/unit/ -vv --cov --cov-report=term
```

The `--cov` (without argument) will use the `source = src` from the config file.

## **Visual Example:**

**Command:** `--cov=src`
```
