Subject: Machine Learning Engineer Role - Excited to Connect

Hi [Hiring Manager/Recruiter Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I recently applied for the Machine Learning Engineer position at Data Solutions Inc and wanted to reach out directly to introduce myself.

I'm a software engineer with 5 years of Python experience who has been intensively transitioning into ML engineering. What drew me to this role is the opportunity to work on production ML systems at scaleâ€”something I've been preparing for through hands-on projects and dedicated learning.

Key highlights:
- 5 years Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Recently completed intensive TensorFlow & PyTorch training
- Built 3 production ML applications (deployed on AWS)
- Strong foundation in software engineering best practices
- AWS certified with Docker/CI-CD experience

I understand the role requires ML-specific experience, and while mine is more recent, I bring strong engineering fundamentals and demonstrated ability to quickly master new technologies. My portfolio showcases production-ready ML systems, not just academic projects.

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of software engineering expertise and ML skills could benefit your team. Would you be open to a brief conversation?
